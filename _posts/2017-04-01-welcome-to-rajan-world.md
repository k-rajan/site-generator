Welcome to Rajan's personal site. This is the place where I will be writting all my views/thoughts/opinions about World speciacially software develepment.

Idea is to start publish my thoughts as form of articles/blogs as here. I will be also publising my old blogs to this site slowly. 

Code snippets will be added to test code highliting, as I will be writting mostly about software development:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name} World"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Rajan World' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

This site will be available at following places to start with. Main site will be [here][Main site], others will be redirects.

Lots of love to jekyll, lanyon, travis-ci, github, cloudflare.
